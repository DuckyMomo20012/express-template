# express-template
My ExpressJS template

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

> If you have error: "node" is incompatible... Then add flag:
> `--ignore-engines`. E.g: `yarn add --ignore-engines PACKAGE_NAME`

## Run server:

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

OR

Run with `nodemon`:

```bash
yarn test
```

> *Nodemon is a utility depended on by over 1.5 million projects, that will
> monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
> Perfect for development.*

Server will run on `localhost:3000`
